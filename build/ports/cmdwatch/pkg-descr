This is the familiar Linux "watch" utility originally written by Tony
Rems <rembo@unisoft.com> with help from Francois Pinard and more recently
Mike Coleman <mkc@acm.org>.  I found it useful, so here it is.  Basically
"watches" the output of a given command at a specified interval in a nice,
ncurses-based format.
