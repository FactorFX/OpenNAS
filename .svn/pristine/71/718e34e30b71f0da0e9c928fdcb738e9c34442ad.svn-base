/**
  The permission engine.

  This function decides wether a specific function is allowed or not
  depending the rights of the current user.

  @param $dir	Directory in which  the action should happen. If this parameter is
  		NULL the engine relys on the global permissions of the user.
  		
  @param $file	File on which the action should happen, if this parameter is NULL
  		the permission engine relys on the permission of the directory.

  @param $action
  		One ore more action of the action set (see permissions_get) which sould
  		be exectuted.
		More actions are seperated by a &.
		
		Example:

		"read&write&password" grants only if user has all three permissions

  @return	true if the action is granted, false otherwise

  @remarks	Until now the permission engine does not support directory or
  		file based actions, so only the global actions are treated. The paramers
		$dir and $file are ignored. This is for later use. However, if possible,
		provide the $dir and $file parameters so the code does not have to
		be chaned if the permission engine will support this features in
		the future.
