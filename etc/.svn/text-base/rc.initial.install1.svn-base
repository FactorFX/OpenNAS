{$productname} 'Embedded' installer for CF, USB Flash Drive or HDD.

- Create 1 partition for OS image
- Uses a RAM disk to limit read/write access to the device

WARNING: There will be some limitations:
1. This will erase ALL partitions and data on the destination disk
2. You can't use your destination disk for sharing data

Installing on CF or USB Flash Drive is the preferred way:
It saves you Power and a IDE/SATA/SCSI channel for more storage drives.
